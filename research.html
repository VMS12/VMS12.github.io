								<h3> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.01847.pdf"><span>Social contagion and asset prices: 
									Reddit's self-organised bull runs</span></a>  </h3>
								<p>
									<em>(with Julian Winkler)</em> <br>
									This paper develops an empirical and theoretical case for how 'hype' among retail investors can 
									drive large asset price fluctuations. We use text data from discussions on WallStreetBets (WSB), 
									an online investor forum with over eleven million followers as of February 2022, 
									as a case study to demonstrate how retail investors influence each other, 
									and how social behaviours impact financial markets. We document that WSB users adopt price 
									predictions about assets (bullish or bearish) in part due to the sentiments expressed by their peers. 
									Discussions about stocks are also self-perpetuating: narratives about specific assets spread at an 
									increasing rate before peaking, and eventually diminishing in importance -- a pattern reminiscent of 
									an epidemiological setting. To consolidate these findings, we develop a model for the impact of social 
									dynamics among retail investors on asset prices. We find that the interplay between 'trend following' 
									and 'consensus formation' determines the stability of price returns, with socially-driven investing 
									potentially causing oscillations and cycles. Our framework helps identify components of asset demand 
									stemming from social dynamics, which we predict using WSB data. 
									Our predictions explain significant variation in stock market activity. 
									These findings emphasise the role that social dynamics play in financial markets, amplified by online 
									social media. <br><hr>

									A comment-reply dataset for (dis)agreement detection in online debates</span></a>  </h3>
								<p>
									<em>(with John Pougué-Biyong, Alexandre Matton, Rachel Han, Aerin Kim, Renaud Lambiotte, Doyne Farmer)</em> <br>
									In this paper, we introduce DEBAGREEMENT, a dataset of 42,894 comment-reply pairs from the popular discussion website Reddit, 
									annotated with agree, neutral or disagree labels. We collect data from five forums on Reddit: r/BlackLivesMatter, r/Brexit, 
									r/climate, r/democrats, r/Republican. For each forum, we select comment pairs such that they form altogether a user 
									interaction graph. DEBAGREEMENT presents a challenge for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, as it contains slang, 
									sarcasm and topic-specific jokes, often present in online exchanges. We evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art 
									language models on a (dis)agreement detection task, and investigate the use of contextual information available (graph, 
									authorship, and temporal information). Since recent research has shown that context, such as social context or knowledge 
									graph information, enables language models to better perform on downstream NLP tasks, DEBAGREEMENT provides novel 
									opportunities for combining graph-based and text-based machine learning techniques to detect (dis)agreements online.

								<h3>From Micro to Macro: Understanding the social dynamics behind political and economic change </h3>
								<p>
									<em>(with John Pougué-Biyong)</em> <br>
									This paper studies the evolution of the Brexit discussion over time. We begin by outlining and testing a novel signed, 
									temporal clustering algorithm on static and temporal, synthetically-generated data. 
									The algorithmic performance justifies itsuse on noisy social media data to better understand the dynamics of the 
									Brexit discussion. We apply the algorithm on a hand-annotated dataset of agreementsand disagreements on 
									ther/Brexit discussion forum on Reddit. The algorithm highlights periods of social turmoil (July-September 2019) 
									and of relative stability (May-August 2020). Our proposed metric for community overlap over time correlates with 
									unemployment and the GBP/USD exchange rate, linking the dataon social discussions to the macroeconomy. 
									We use Natural Language Processing(NLP) techniques to offer qualitative insights into the discussion.

								<h3>The Wealth of Nations: a machine learning perspective </h3>

							<h3>The Heterogeneity of Product Prices </h3>
							<p>
								<em>(with Jangho Yang, François Lafond, Doyne Farmer)</em> <br>
								In this paper, we follow in the well-established tradition of studying product prices at a fine-grained level; 
								however, propose a different approach. We do not focus on a single sector or theory to motivate our study 
								of product prices, but rather strive to build an understanding of the economy from the bottom up. 
								We compile a comprehensive, granular dataset tracking product prices across seven developed countries. 
								We, subsequently, use two simple characteristics to study product prices - individual product inflation rates 
								and the volatility of product prices.
